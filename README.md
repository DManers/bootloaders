USB Bootloaders for 8- and 32-bit Pinguino.

A bootloader is a piece of code that is executed once the system is booted.
The code runs inside the microcontroller and is responsible for transferring your application from your PC to the
microcontroller memory and handing over the control to this application afterwards.
